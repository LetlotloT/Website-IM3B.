    <p>The purpose of this paper is to give a summary and critical reflection on Qi Li’s chapter, ‘Overview of Data Visualization’, from Embodying Data. In the chapter, Li gives an idea of what data visualisation is. He highlights a number of definitions for ‘data visualisation’, highlighting Nikos Bikakis’ definition as a conclusive and inclusive definition of the term. Bikakis’ definition reads: 
        “Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format, and a data visualization tool is the software that generates this presentation. Data visualization provides users with intuitive means to interactively explore and analyze data, enabling them to effectively identify interesting patterns, infer correlations and causalities, and supports sense-making activities“ (in Li, 2020:19). 
        Visual representation of data has been highly influenced by the invention of the computer, moving from hand drawing, to “photo-etching”, to using computer graphics and software (Li, 2020:17; Friendly in Li, 2020:17). Moreover, the impact of computer technology in the visual representation of data has also allowed for the manipulation of data for exploration and analysis in an easier and more affordable way (Li, 2020:17).  
        </p>
    <p>‘Information’ and ‘data’ are used a number of times throughout the chapter. The two terms are used in different contexts, and different ways. A section of the chapter focuses on explaining ‘data’ and ‘information’. ‘Data’ refers to raw unprocessed information that does not give any meaning in the context of a study (Li, 2020:20). Information, on the other hand, is considered collections of data, processed, conveying significance and meaning (Zins in Li, 2020: 21) Moreover, data is categorised into two forms: primary and secondary data (Li, 2020:20). Primary data is data collected from respondents (raw), and secondary data is information from data, however, does not act as information (does not give meaning) in the current context (Li, 2020:20). The differentiation of data into these forms suggests that all information is data, however, data only becomes information for a specific purpose (Li, 2020:22) in a specific context. </p>
    <p>Li focuses their research on data visualisation that focuses on communication for understanding, and calls this traditional data visualisation (2020:17). He categorises traditional data visualisation into two sub-sections: information visualisation and scientific visualisation (2020:19). Information visualisation is used to visually represent abstract data, while scientific visualisation represents scientific data (Spence in Li, 2020:19). Common characteristics of traditional data visualisation include: (1) readability: being legible and decipherable; (2) recognisability: being able to be recognised and identified from previous encounters and/or other knowledge; and (3) meaning: a visual representation that is understandable (	Li, 2020:41, 42).</p>
    <p>Traditional data visualisation utilises many forms to structure data, for it to be readable and have meaning. Data visualisation forms have been developed to optimize selecting and creating the most effective and efficient transformation of data into information (Senay and Ignatius in Li, 2020:22). Different forms are used for different purposes and for a variety of disciplines and/or research fields (Li, 2020:21).  Among the many available, Li gives an overview for each of the following: trees, maps, scatter plots, charts, tables, diagrams, graphs, waveform, simulation, and volume.</p>
    <p>Lastly, Li goes into the role of the human perception in data visualisation. Human perception is to subject mental activities, which interpret data and information received around the environment (Ward in Li, 2020:42). Perception refers to the way sensory data is organized, interpreted and consciously experienced (Ward in Li, 2020:42). Perception can be defined as “the process of being aware of, gathering and storing, and interpreting sensory information” (Ward in Li, 2020:42). Also, research on perception involves the distortion of scenes, illusion (Li, 2020:45).</p>
    <p>From ‘Overview of Data Visualization’, it can be suggested that the beginning of understanding data and data having meaning is not how it is processed, organised or structured. It is how it is perceived. Paul Tukey discusses optical illusions, how components of a picture can interact with each other to affect perception (Reuter, 1990:402). People may perceive the same picture in different ways, depending on physiology (visual impairments) but also depending on prior experience and what they are ”looking for”  (Reuter, 1990:402). Perception, therefore, becomes the first tool for converting data into meaningful information. From this it can be said that data, organised on an image, is also unprocessed data. It, therefore, becomes paramount for graphical displays to be accompanied by information that contextualises them.</p>
    <p>Images allow for information to be grasped quickly, however, images are susceptible to uncertainties and might require declarative statements to support them (Gershon and Ward, 2001:32). Nahum Gershon and Page Ward highlight the importance of storytelling in information visualisation. They say that information visualisation is more than just a single image, “it’s kind of a show business” (2001:34).  In ‘Titles, Captions, and Tables’ Claus Wilke discusses the importance of data source statements that accompany data visualisation. He says: To reliably achieve this goal when preparing visualizations, we have to place the data into context and provide accompanying titles, captions, and other annotations (2019:267). Captions and annotations are necessary tools to further give meaning to data displayed on images, help the reader understand the data, and help them find the information the image was purposed for. Captions and annotations form part of the information and meaning presented by the picture.</p>
    <p>Definitions of data visualisation highlight the idea of presenting data in a visual form. However, what data visualisation does is it also turns data into information through the organisation of data into visual form. Therefore, it can be concluded that data visualisation is not only a matter of presenting data in a readable, recognisable, and meaningful format, it is the very act of processing data. Graphical displays are information.</p>
    <p>Lastly, some limitations of data visualisation which can undermine the very purpose of the process include its biasedness and its inability to produce accuracy (only estimates) (Hoffman, n.d.). Part of the process of data visualisation is choosing what is important to show and what can be left out, This can lead to biased results. Biased results prioritise a part of data, and may result in misperceptions of the data collected. Likewise, data visualisation’s inability to produce accuracy may result in misconceptions and misperceptions of data collected. Moreover, when graphical displays show biased information, the very purpose of data visualisation is undermined because it produces falls meanings and conclusions.</p>
    <p>Data visualisation is not only the process of presenting data in pictorial forms, it the very act of processing data. Graphical displays are, therefore, both representations of data, and information. However, it is safe to say that a large part of data visualisation is dependent on humans’ involvement with the process, from producing the data by means of selecting what is important to be in the representation, to understanding and finding meaning that the image is purposed for.</p>
