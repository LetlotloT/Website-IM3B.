    <p>In the chapter ‘What is design?’ Victor Papanek says that all humans are designers. 
        Design, according to Papanek, is the conscious and intuitive effort to impose 
        meaningful order. One cannot separate design and make it stand on its own because
        design is the primary underlying matrix of life. In ‘User Experience – a research 
        agenda’, Marc Hassenzahl and Noam Tractinsky give a broad definition of UX: 
    </p>
    <p>
        UX is about technology that fulfils more than just instrumental needs in a way that acknowledges its use 
        as a subjective, situated, complex and dynamic encounter. UX is a consequence of a user’s internal state 
        (predispositions, expectations, needs, motivation, mood, etc.), the characteristics of the designed system 
        (e.g. complexity, purpose, usability, functionality, etc.) and the context (or the environment) within which 
        the interaction occurs (e.g. organisational/social setting, meaningfulness of the actiVITY voluntariness of 
        use, etc.).
    </p>
    <p> UX and UI design become the primary underlying matrix of a website. Here, using 
        Hassenzahl and Tractinsky’s definition and some supporting principles, I will give a 
        critical reflection on my UX and UI design.
    </p>
    <p> The process used for my UX and UI design was to begin by putting some ideas on paper 
        by sketching some wireframes. The designs grew from these sketches to a style
        tile/mood board where non concluded ideas were put down. From the mood board, color 
        palettes and font palettes with chosen, and wireframes were revisited and resketched.

    <p>This is a scroll down website where every page link is found on the home page of the website. The home page is divided into sections where a link to each part of the website can be found on the home page. The website is designed for musicians and utilizes a musician's everyday work in the studio to interact with the website. The home page of the website is designed like a piano and each black note on the piano serves as a section of the website. In this way the website keeps one theme throughout the most interactive page on the website. This ticks the familiarity box of checklist and also follows the consistency principle of UI design. However, the weakness with this design is that a user (in this case a musician) May not be expecting to interact with the website like he or she interacts with a piano in the studio. Therefore, the user may find it difficult to interact with the website unfamiliar with this kind of interactivity with our website. 
     </p>
    <p>The website has a header, footer and scroll up arrow button at the bottom for shortcut and accessibility purposes. Instead of a menu bar at the header, the website uses a burger menu that is fixed when scrolling down each page. Also, the first black note on the piano acts as a shortcut section holding updates made on the website. Furthermore, when hovering over a black key, drop down menus appear as shortcuts to the section of the website hovered on. However, when most of the activity on the of the website is the homepage, creating too many shortcuts on one page may cause confusion and too much information put in one place.  
    </p>
    <p>The piano theme of the website serves to put the user in the context of the website without including pictures and photos that may delay the loading of content on the website upon request. The burger menu also serves for the responsivity of the website across many devices. Also, when hovering over a hyperlink each hyperlink hovered upon responds to keep the user engaged, aware on my end help the user navigate the page. 
    </p>
    <p>Three sets of color themes were chosen for this website: yellow, blue and black. For the visualization of the data on the website multiple colours are necessary. However, it is important that not too many colour themes are used throughout the website. The black-to-white palette act as the background and main theme of the website, along with its shades of gray found between the two colours. Yellow is used for the responsivity of the website, while both yellow and blue are used for data visualization purposes. Two main colour palettes, yellow and black-to-white are used as the two main themes of the website. However incorporating yellow in the piano theme of the may cause confusion, where yellow causes inconsistencies. Afterall, simplicity is what is strived for. These themes and where they are designated are used throughout the website to maintain clarity in hierarchy in the website.
    </p>
    <p>Lastly, two font themes are used. One is used for headings while the other is used for paragraphs. The two fonts themes are used in different sizes and font styles for hierarchy purposes and clear messaging. Both Montserrat and Quicksand are chosen for their clarity and readability purposes. Also both fonts a properly and evenly spaced out, and familiar it users across all other websites. Both these fonts styles have clean white space in between them, which make it easy to read. Lastly, the fonts are different enough to be used for different purposes on the website but also similar enough to make sure there's consistency in font styles throughout the website.
